## Dependency Management

This repository uses [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) for automated dependency updates. The Dependency Dashboard issue tracks all pending updates and can be found in the Issues tab.

### Features of our Renovate setup:

- Automated dependency updates run every weekend
- Minor and patch updates are automatically merged
- Development dependencies are automatically merged
- Semantic commit messages for dependency updates
- Dependency Dashboard for monitoring updates

For more information, see the [Renovate documentation](https://docs.renovatebot.com/key-concepts/dashboard/).
